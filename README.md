# jQuery Boilerplate

## A boilerplate for jump-starting jQuery plugins development.
Contains lots of comments to help you get going easily. It is truly object-oriented, it implements public and private methods as well as public and private properties, making it the ideal candidate for when building both simple and complex jQuery plugins.

## What's in the box?
 
 - jQuery 1.6.2 (used by Jasmine)
 - Jasmine for all your TDD needs
 - CoffeeScript because writing regular JS sucks
 - a Cakefile for building / minifying
 - a Guardfile for continuous development
 - a Brewfile for OS X package management
 
## What do I have to touch to get it running?

 - The Cakefile to process the correct files
 - the src/plugin.coffee file to correct the plugin name
 - the spec/javascript/*.coffee files for the tests
 
## Installation

 - git clone this project
 - run `brewdle install`
 - run `bundle install`
 - now `guard` should work for you - happy coding, that's all

## Have you created a plugin from our boilerplate?
Let us know! Soon we're going to have a gallery to display them all.
