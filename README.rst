===================================
jQuery Plugin Boilerplate 
===================================

A boilerplate for jump-starting jQuery plugins development.

Contains lots of comments to help you get going easily. It is truly object-oriented, it implements public and private methods as well as public and private properties, making it the ideal candidate for when building both simple and complex jQuery plugins.
It does not adhere to the suggestions made by the jQuery documentation regarding Plugins/Authoring and by doing so it provides better performance and memory usage by not creating multiple instances of itself and attaching them to the target DOM elements.
